### Compatibility Testing

- **Python Versions:** 3.8 ✅, 3.9 ✅, 3.10 ✅, 3.11 ✅
- **Operating Systems:** Linux ✅, Windows ✅, macOS ✅
- **Dependencies:** All pip packages install correctly

## Remaining Issues & Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **API Key Security**
   - Issue: Keys stored in plain text configs
   - Recommendation: Use keyring or environment variables
   - Workaround: Document secure key management

2. **Memory Management**
   - Issue: Large images load entirely into memory
   - Recommendation: Implement streaming/chunked processing
   - Workaround: Document memory requirements

### Medium Priority
3. **Progress Feedback**
   - Issue: No progress bars for long operations
   - Recommendation: Add tqdm progress indicators
   - Impact: User experience

4. **Batch Processing**
   - Issue: Single material at a time
   - Recommendation: Add batch mode for multiple materials
   - Impact: Efficiency for production use

### Low Priority
5. **Format Support**
   - Issue: PNG output only
   - Recommendation: Add JPEG, EXR, TIFF support
   - Impact: Storage optimization

6. **Preview Enhancement**
   - Issue: Basic grid preview
   - Recommendation: Add 3D material preview
   - Impact: Visual validation
